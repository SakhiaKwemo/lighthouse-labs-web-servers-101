## HTTP

* Built on TCP, but has key differences
* Follows a request-response pattern
* Application-based layer
* Stateless (all requests are treated as brand-new!)
* Status codes (200 OK; 404 NOT FOUND; 500 SERVER ERROR)
* URL (resource location); and VERB/METHOD (GET / POST)
* Headers sent in each request and response

## What is a Client?

A device / software capable of making requests to a server.

Examples:

* Video game executable (acts as a client reaching out to a game server)
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
* Smart home / security devices
* Google Maps / Earth
* cURL
* Postman
* Web Servers / Web Applications (tricky!! But they are capable of making requests too!)
